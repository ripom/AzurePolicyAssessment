## What Does This Script Do?

This PowerShell script scans your Azure tenant and reports on **all policy assignments** across management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups. It uses **Azure Resource Graph** for fast execution and produces:

- A **console summary** of every directly-assigned policy (excluding inherited), grouped by scope
- **Security, cost, and compliance impact** ratings for each assignment
- **Azure Landing Zone gap analysis** — highlights missing policies compared to the official ALZ reference
- **UK Cyber Essentials Plus mapping** with [CE+ v3.2 test specification](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/cyber-essentials-plus-test-specification-v3-2.pdf) (TC1–TC5)
- **Policy exemptions** — lists all exemptions with scope, category, expiry, and coverage detail
- Optional **CSV, HTML, YAML** exports for offline analysis, reporting, and delta comparison

## Prerequisites

### PowerShell Version

- **PowerShell 7.0 or later** is required. Windows PowerShell 5.1 is **not supported**.
- To check your version: `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`
- Install PowerShell 7: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)

### Required Modules

- **Az.Accounts**: For Azure authentication and context management
- **Az.Resources**: For management group and subscription queries
- **Az.ResourceGraph**: For high-performance policy and compliance queries (NEW in v2.1)

### Installation

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Az.Accounts -Force -AllowClobber
Install-Module -Name Az.Resources -Force -AllowClobber
Install-Module -Name Az.ResourceGraph -Force -AllowClobber
```

### Azure Permissions

The account running the script needs:
- **Reader** access or higher on management groups
- **Reader** access on policy assignments
- Typically requires at least **Management Group Reader** role at the tenant root level
- **Note**: Azure Resource Graph queries respect existing RBAC permissions automatically

**Permission Errors**: If you encounter permission errors, the script will provide specific guidance on required roles. Contact your Azure administrator to grant appropriate access.

## Usage

### Execution Modes

The script assesses all scopes by default (Management Groups, Subscriptions, Resource Groups). Use `-ManagementGroup` or `-Subscription` to filter to a specific scope.

See [OUTPUT-OPTIONS.md](OUTPUT-OPTIONS.md) for detailed examples.

### Basic Execution

1. **Connect to Azure** (if not already connected):
   ```powershell
   Connect-AzAccount
   ```

2. **Run the script**:
   ```powershell
   # Basic execution — all scopes assessed by default
   .\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1
   
   # Quick executive summary
   .\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -QuickAssess

   # Export to CSV and HTML
   .\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -Output CSV,HTML

   # Cyber Essentials Plus compliance with test cases
   .\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -CEP Full

   # Full assessment — everything enabled
   .\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -Full
   
   # Specify tenant ID (skip tenant selection prompt)
   .\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -TenantId "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
   
   # Filter to a specific management group
   .\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -ManagementGroup "mg-platform" -Output HTML

   # Filter to a specific subscription
   .\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -Subscription "Production" -Output CSV

   # Export YAML database for delta comparison
   .\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -Output YAML

   # Compare against a previous YAML snapshot
   .\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -DeltaYAML ".\PolicyAssessment_20260218.yaml" -Output HTML
   ```

3. **Select a tenant** when prompted (if you have access to multiple tenants and didn't specify -TenantId)

4. **Review the output** in the console

5. **CSV export** (optional): Use the `-Export` switch to save results to CSV files.

### Parameters

- **`-Output`** (`CSV`, `HTML`, `NC`, `YAML`, `All`): Controls which exports are generated. Accepts one or more comma-separated values.
  - `CSV` — Export policy assignments to timestamped CSV file
  - `HTML` — Generate comprehensive interactive HTML report
  - `NC` — Export all non-compliant resources to CSV
  - `YAML` — Export full assessment database to YAML (for delta comparisons)
  - `All` — All of the above

- **`-CEP`** (`Show`, `Test`, `Export`, `Full`): Controls Cyber Essentials compliance features.
  - `Show` — Display CE v3.1 compliance analysis in console
  - `Test` — Run CE+ v3.2 Test Specification (TC1–TC5)
  - `Export` — Export CE compliance data to CSV
  - `Full` — All of the above

- **`-ManagementGroup`**: Filter the assessment to a specific Management Group by name or ID.

- **`-Subscription`**: Filter the assessment to a specific Subscription by name or ID.

- **`-TenantId`**: Optional tenant ID to skip the tenant selection prompt. Useful for automation.

- **`-FileName`**: Custom filename for CSV export (e.g., `"MyReport.csv"`). Used with `-Output CSV`.

- **`-QuickAssess`**: Produces a concise one-page Quick Assessment: posture verdict, top 5 gaps, top 5 non-compliant assignments, and key actions.

- **`-DeltaYAML`**: Path to a previous YAML assessment database (generated with `-Output YAML`). Produces a comprehensive policy-by-policy comparison showing new, removed, and changed assignments, compliance drift, effect type shifts, exemption changes, and overall posture trend.

- **`-Full`**: Runs a comprehensive assessment with all features enabled (equivalent to `-Output All -CEP Full`).

- **`-Update`**: Self-update switch. Downloads the latest version of the script from GitHub, validates it has no parse errors, creates a backup of the current version (e.g., `Get-PolicyAssignments-v3.0.0-backup.ps1`), replaces the local script file, and exits so you can re-run with the new version. No Azure login required.

## Overview

This PowerShell script analyzes Azure Policy assignments across all management groups in an Azure tenant. It retrieves policy assignments directly assigned to each management group, excluding inherited policies from parent management groups, providing a clear view of the policy governance structure.

**NEW in v3.0**: Simplified CLI (`-Output`, `-CEP`), real policy metadata, CE+ v3.2 test specification (TC1–TC5), Quick Assess mode, delta/trending!  
**IMPORTANT**: This script is specifically designed for and optimized for **Azure Landing Zone (ALZ) management group structures**. All recommendations and gap analysis are based on the standard ALZ architecture. The script will work with any management group hierarchy, but the policy recommendations are most meaningful when applied to an ALZ-compliant structure.

### Azure Landing Zone Management Group Structure

This script is designed to work with the standard Azure Landing Zone management group hierarchy:

```
Tenant Root Group
│
└── <Organization> (e.g., Contoso)
    │
    ├── Platform
    │   ├── Management
    │   ├── Connectivity
    │   └── Identity
    │
    ├── Landing Zones
    │   ├── Corp (Corporate workloads)
    │   └── Online (Internet-facing workloads)
    │
    ├── Sandboxes (Innovation/testing)
    │
    └── Decommissioned (Workloads being retired)
```

**Why ALZ Structure Matters**:
- Policy recommendations are tailored to each management group type (Platform, Landing Zones, etc.)
- The script validates against ALZ best practices and standard policy assignments
- Gap analysis identifies missing policies based on ALZ reference implementation
- Without an ALZ structure, many recommendations may not be applicable to your environment

## Script Logic

### Management Group Discovery

1. Retrieves all root management groups using `Get-AzManagementGroup`
2. Recursively expands each management group to discover all children
3. Builds a complete list of all management groups in the tenant hierarchy

### Policy Assignment Filtering

For each management group:
1. Retrieves all policy assignments using `Get-AzPolicyAssignment -Scope`
2. Filters assignments to include only those where:
   - `assignment.Scope` exactly matches the current management group scope
   - This excludes inherited policies from parent management groups
3. Extracts policy metadata and creates structured output

### Key Filtering Logic

```powershell
# Only include direct assignments (not inherited)
if ($assignment.Scope -eq "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/$($mg.Name)") {
    # Process this assignment
}
```

## Output Details

### Console Output

- **Progress indicators**: Shows which management group is being processed
- **Assignment classification**: 
  - `✓ Direct`: Policy is directly assigned to this MG
  - `- Inherited`: Policy is inherited from a parent MG (not included in results)
- **Count summaries**: Total vs direct assignments per management group

### CSV Export

**Export Behavior**: The script does NOT export to CSV by default. Use the `-Export` switch to save results.

**Filename options**:
- **Default**: `PolicyAssignments_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` (timestamped)
- **Custom**: Use `-FileName "YourCustomName.csv"` parameter
- **CE+ Compliance**: `CyberEssentialsPlus_Compliance_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` (when using `-CEP Export`)

**Location**: Current directory

**Columns included**: All policy details including Assignment Name, Display Name, Policy Type, Effect Type, Enforcement Mode, Security Impact, Cost Impact, Compliance Impact, Operational Overhead, Risk Level, Scope details, Parameters

**Examples**:
```powershell
# Export with default timestamped filename
.\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -Output CSV

# Export with custom filename
.\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -Output CSV -FileName "Q4-PolicyAudit.csv"

# Export Cyber Essentials Plus compliance report
.\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -CEP Export

# Export with date-based filename
.\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -Output CSV -FileName "Policies_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd').csv"
```

### Cyber Essentials Plus Compliance

The script assesses your environment against UK Cyber Essentials Plus (CE+) requirements using the built-in **UK NCSC Cyber Essentials v3.1** Azure Policy Initiative. See the [Azure CE+ Compliance Offering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-uk-cyber-essentials-plus) for details.

⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE**  
- This tool does **NOT provide official CE+ certification**
- Use for **guidance only** — not for compliance attestation
- See [CYBER-ESSENTIALS-PLUS.md](CYBER-ESSENTIALS-PLUS.md) for full limitations

**Usage**:
```powershell
# Console output only
.\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -CEP Show

# Run CE+ v3.2 test cases (TC1–TC5)
.\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -CEP Test

# Export CE+ compliance to CSV
.\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -CEP Export

# Full CE+ assessment
.\Get-PolicyAssignments.ps1 -CEP Full
```

**See also**: [Cyber Essentials Plus Documentation](CYBER-ESSENTIALS-PLUS.md)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Not logged in to Azure"
- **Solution**: Run `Connect-AzAccount` before executing the script

**Issue**: "ERROR: Unable to retrieve management groups" or "Access Denied" messages
- **Solution**: 
  - Verify you have at least **Reader** permissions on management groups
  - Contact your Azure administrator to grant **Management Group Reader** role at tenant root level
  - The script will provide specific guidance when permission errors are detected

**Issue**: "No management groups found"
- **Solution**: 
  - Verify you have appropriate permissions on management groups
  - Ensure your Azure environment has management groups configured
  - This script is designed for Azure Landing Zone structures - verify ALZ implementation

**Issue**: Script shows 0 assignments
- **Solution**: Check if policies are assigned at subscription or resource group level instead of management groups

**Issue**: Missing expected management groups
- **Solution**: Ensure you selected the correct tenant and have appropriate permissions to view all management groups

**Issue**: Many policies show as "MISSING" despite being deployed
- **Solution**: 
  - This is expected if your environment doesn't follow the standard Azure Landing Zone structure
  - Policy recommendations are based on ALZ best practices
  - If you're not using ALZ, use the CSV export to analyze your actual policy coverage

**Issue**: Recommendations don't seem relevant to your environment
- **Solution**: 
  - This script is optimized for **Azure Landing Zone management group structures**
  - If you're not using ALZ, focus on the direct assignment data rather than gap analysis
  - Consider implementing ALZ structure for enterprise-grade governance

**Issue**: Parameters column shows "(no parameters)" for most policies
- **Solution**: This is a known limitation. The Azure PowerShell `Get-AzPolicyAssignment` cmdlet's `Parameter` property is often empty or incomplete due to API restrictions. The script attempts to extract parameter values but Azure's API doesn't always expose them through standard PowerShell cmdlets. To view full parameter details, check the Azure Portal or use Azure Resource Graph queries.

### Debugging

The script includes verbose output that shows:
- Which management groups were discovered
- How many assignments found per MG
- Which assignments are direct vs inherited

Review the console output to identify where policies are actually assigned.

## Use Cases

1. **Governance Audit**: Understand which policies are assigned at each management group level
2. **Policy Cleanup**: Identify duplicate or unnecessary policy assignments
3. **Compliance Reporting**: Document current policy governance structure
4. **Migration Planning**: Map policies before restructuring management groups
5. **Security Assessment**: Review security policies across organizational hierarchy with detailed security posture analysis showing:
   - Which high-impact security policies are deployed
   - Effect types (Deny, DeployIfNotExists, Modify) and enforcement status
   - Gaps in security controls compared to Azure Landing Zone best practices
   - Critical areas covered (network security, encryption, access control, backup/DR)
6. **Impact Analysis**: Evaluate cost, security, and compliance impact of current policy assignments
7. **Azure Landing Zone Validation**: Compare deployed policies against ALZ recommendations
8. **Risk Assessment**: Identify high-risk policy configurations and enforcement gaps

## Limitations

- **Scope**: All scopes (Management Groups, Subscriptions, Resource Groups) are assessed by default. Use `-ManagementGroup` or `-Subscription` to filter.
- **Permissions**: Requires appropriate Azure permissions (Reader) on queried scopes. ARG queries respect RBAC automatically.
- **ALZ Context**: Policy recommendations and gap analysis are based on **Azure Landing Zone structure** - results are most meaningful in ALZ-compliant environments.
- **Connectivity**: Azure Landing Zone validation requires internet connectivity to fetch latest policies from the official [Azure Landing Zones Library](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Landing-Zones-Library) (falls back to cached list if offline).
